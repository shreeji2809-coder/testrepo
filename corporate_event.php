                                    <h5><b>Different types  of corporate events</b></h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Business events might include team outings, client hospitality, and internal seminars. 
                                        Consequently, we also evaluate business events in terms of their scale when making planning decisions. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h5><b>Conferences </b></h5>
                                    <p>
                                        People within similar industries can exchange ideas and interact at conferences. 
                                        These gatherings span several days and feature innumerable workshops and guest speakers. Frequently, conferences involve guest lectures, networking opportunities and breakout sessions. 
                                        For large events, we get you a complete convention center or a big space to conduct the event.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5><b>Seminars</b></h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Similar to conferences, seminars bring experts in the same field together to learn more about a specific subject. 
                                        Yet, seminars are compact gatherings compared to conferences. These normally last only a few hours and can be highly interactive.
                                        A seminar can comprise people giving lectures by a group or individual.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5><b>Product Launches</b></h5>
                                    <p>
                                        The release of a new product assists businesses in creating a constructive discussion around its most recent goods and services. Media representatives may also be invited to write about the new introduction into the market, giving the product enough leverage and propaganda. This particular corporate event may involve inviting guest lecturers, celebrity guests, entertainment, and giving away goodie bags. 
                                        Melodia executes all formalities involved in a product launch event. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h5><b>Board Meetings</b></h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Typically, board meetings happen once or twice a year. During this time, the company’s financial situation and general health are examined, and in case of any discrepancies, the board revises certain strategies and other crucial business choices in light of its findings. 
                                        The board must meet at a stipulated place and time to make wise and informed decisions, preferably in a high-end hotel with an exclusive space.
                                    </p>

                                    <h5><b>Corporate Dinners</b></h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Corporate Dinners come in a variety of formats and comprise various goals and a variety of guests. 
                                        Business meals during these times are not uncommon, and new members may be welcomed to the team. The event is held to reward employees, boost their morale, and mark milestones. 
                                        A business-related meal has a specific objective in mind and is more likely a strategy session. Therefore, we book a prestigious restaurant and a sophisticated meal that might even be held to please a new client or seal a contract.
